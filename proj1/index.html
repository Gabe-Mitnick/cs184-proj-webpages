  <h1>CS 184: Computer Graphics and Imaging, Spring 2023</h1>
  <h1>Project 2: Mesh Edit</h1>
  <h2>Gabriel Mitnick and William Fei</h2>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    In this project, we implemented a variety of algorithms to create and render meshes. We started by implementing de Casteljau subdivision for 2D Bézier curves. Next, we extended this formula to work with 3D Bézier surfaces. We then explored triangle meshes, implementing area-weighted vertex normals to display surfaces more smoothly, and adding support for flip and split operations in the halfedge data structure. Finally, we implemented loop subdivision which upsample meshes to create smoother objects.
  </p>

  <h2>Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

  <h3>Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h3>


  <b>
    Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.
  </b>
  <p>
    In computer graphics, we often require a method to represent smooth, continuous curves. We want to be able to draw these curves through any predefined points, and be able to link curves together indefinitely. We are able to achieve all this using the Bézier curve.
  </p>
  <p>
    This technology powers the resolution-independent SVG file format. It allows us to create fluid typefaces at all scales such that on-screen text looks good from 12pt to 72pt. The Bézier curve is used in highway route modeling, networks, robotics, and has applications in many other fields.
  </p>
  <p>
    We evaluate Bézier curves using a method called de Casteljau's algorithm. This algorithm recursively applies <b>linear interpolation</b> to compute a Bézier Curve. Linear interpolation is defined as follows: Given u, (1 - u)A + uB is the point C that divides AB in the ratio u:1-u. To explain how we arrived at this value, take a vector from A to B represented by B - A. Define the variable u, which is a ratio between 0 and 1 that represents the distance traveled along the line. Therefore, point C would be located at C = A + u(B - A) = (1 - u)A + uB.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our implementation of <i>evaluateStep()</i> performs one step of de Casteljau's algorithm. We initialize a 2Dvector <i>result</i> then iterate through each pair of consecutive points in 2Dvector points and perform the lerp function between them (evaluated at parameter t). We use <i>result.push_back()</i> to store each newly computed point, building our return vector following one step of de Casteljau. This return vector will contain one fewer point than the previous; if there were only two points to begin with, our function returns the final interpolated vector.
  </p>

  <h3>Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
  <b>
    Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier surfaces.
  </b>
  <p>
    Beyond 1D Bézier curves, de Casteljau's algorithm is also applicable to 2D Bézier surfaces. A Bézier surface is defined by a 2D Bézier patch of <i>m×n</i> control points. We can interpret these control points as follows: we perform de Casteljau on each row of control points to compute <i>m</i> values. Then these <i>m</i> values serve as the control points for another Bézier curve. More specifically, we will perform de Casteljau's algorithm by looping through the curves to determine a point at parameter <i>u</i> defined by each <i>m</i>. Then, we repeat de Casteljau at parameter <i>v</i> in the <i>n</i> dimension to interpolate a single, final vector.
  </p>
  <p>
    In implementation, we used a loop that traverses all <i>m</i> rows and stores its points in 3Dvector <i>uPoints</i>. Then, we perform one additional runthrough of de Casteljau using all of <i>uPoints</i> and time parameter <i>v</i>. The function <i>evaluate1D</i> makes it convenient for us to compute all 3 levels of de Casteljau with a single call.</p>

  <h2>Section II: Triangle Meshes and Half-Edge Data Structure</h2>

  <h3>Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h3>

  <p>
    In this section, we delve into triangle meshes, another data format used for 3D geometric modeling. Triangle meshes consist of a large number of triangles which are linked into shapes by common edges and vertices. In order to keep track of so many triangles and their connectivities, we utilize the power of the half-edge data structure.
  </p>
  <p>
    The half-edge data structure stores triangle vertices, edges, and faces. It also stores half-edges which allow us to access the “twin” edges of neighboring triangles. Algorithmically accessing edges and their twins allows us to traverse polygon meshes.
  </p>
  <b>
    Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.
  </b>
  <p>
    To implement area-weighted vertex normals, we start by taking our vertex in consideration and using a do-while loop to iterate through every incident face (the faces which share this common vertex).
  </p>
  <p>
    Beginning with the first face, we obtain the two vectors corresponding to the direction and length of the two edges incident to the target vertex <code>v1 = h-&gt;vertex()-&gt;position - position</code> and <code>v2 = h-&gt;next()-&gt;twin()-&gt;vertex()-&gt;position - position</code>. We then compute the cross product of these two vectors and add it to the 3D vector <i>result</i>. The direction of the cross product is normal to the face and its magnitude is proportional to the area of the face.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, we repeat this calculation on the next face. The line <code>h = h-&gt;next()-&gt;twin()</code> traverses to the next incident half-edge. The <i>result</i> vector continues to add subsequent cross products.
  </p>
  <p>
    This process is repeated on every face incident to the initial vector. Upon returning to the initial halfedge, we break out of the do-while loop. At this point, we normalize the result vector to obtain our final result, the approximate unit normal at this vertex.
  </p>

  <h3>Part 4: Edge Flip</h3>
  <b>
    Briefly explain how you implemented the edge flip operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
  </b>
  <p>
    The edge-flip operation is one common operation to modify a mesh. It replaces an edge with one that goes between the two opposite vertices of its two neighboring triangles.
  </p>
  <p>
    Implementation: We began by fetching every halfedge, vertex, and face of the two neighboring triangles. Then, for each halfedge, we reassign the nexts, twins, faces, etc. with <i>setNeighbors</i> to their new values post-edge-flip, and we respecify the halfedges for each vertex and face. Another thing to note, this function requires that neither neighboring face can be on a boundary. We satisfied this requirement by performing an initial call to isBoundary(), and if true, we set the function to immediately return.
  </p>
  <p>
    Interesting implementation/debugging tricks: Before implementing edge flip in code, we first worked out the logic on paper for thoroughness’ sake. This would help us stay organized during debugging as we knew this task would require us to reassign many pointers. This visual aid saved us a lot of time in the long run as we were able to get this function to work correctly on our first attempts.

  <p>
    We thankfully got the implementation correct on one of our first attempts due to our thorough prework on pencil and paper.

  <br>


  <h3>Part 5: Edge Split</h3>
  <b>
    Briefly explain how you implemented the edge split operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
  </b>
  <p>
    The edge split operation is another method to modify meshes. It takes two neighboring triangles and “splits” the triangle into four via the common edge’s midpoint.
  </p>
  <p>
    Implementation: We underwent a similar process as that of edge-flip, but it required more pointer work, creating new edges, faces, and vertices. We similarly wrote an initial call to <i>isBoundary()</i> to ignore requests to split boundary edges.
  </p>
  <p>
    Interesting implementation/debugging tricks: We again drew out a diagram on paper before proceeding with code.

  <h3>Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h3>
  <p>
    Loop subdivision is a method of upsampling a mesh, increasing its resolution to make it smoother. It requires us to subdivide each triangle into four smaller triangles, and then update the coordinates of each vertex based on a weighted average with its neighbors.
  </p>
  <b>
    Briefly explain how you implemented the loop subdivision and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
  </b>
  <p>
    Implementation: First, we iterate through each existing vertex and reset isNew to false. For each vertex, we iterate over its neighbor vertices and sum their vertex locations (stored as <code>neighborSum</code>). We can then determine the new vertex coordinates using formula <code>(1 - n * u) * originalCoordinates + u * neighborSum</code>. Here, <code>n</code> is the vertex degree, and <code>u</code> is 3/16 if <code>n == 3</code>, else 3/(8n). We store the new coordinates in <code>v-&gt;newPosition</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Second, we iterate through every edge, setting their isNew() to false, then computing the updated vertex positions associated with each edge. We utilize the formula 3/8 * (A + B) + 1/8 * (C + D) where (A, B) is the shared edge and C and D are the other two vertices that compose the two faces.
  </p>
  <p>
    Third, we split every edge in the mesh, utilizing the splitEdge() function from part five. The flipEdge() function from part four is then used to flip any new edge that joins an old and new vertex. Finally, for each vertex <code>v</code>, we copy <code>v-&gt;newPosition</code> into <code>v-&gt;position</code>.
  </p>
  <p>Eventful Debugging journey: Our initial results from loop subdivision were very wrong. First, we commented out each part of the function and found that the problem only happened when we uncommented the edge flipping part of the algorithm. We assumed that there must have been a problem with the edge flip function that we hadn’t caught before. But while debugging, we found that when we commented out the edge flipping stage and used the mesh viewer’s keyboard controls to flip the edges that needed to be flipped, the result looked much better. The resulting surface was a bit wobbly, and we found a bug in the weighting scheme (a silly <code>if (n != 3)</code> that needed to be <code>if (n == 3)”</code>). Still, after we fixed it, the edge flip stage of the code was leaving strange holes and protruding triangles in the mesh. After re-reading the lecture slides, we found another bug in the loop subdivision function: we were flipping any edge that went between a new vertex and an old vertex, but had forgotten to check that the edge itself was new. But fixing this bug still yielded a bizarre mesh result. Finally, we found a third bug in the edge split function. We had been setting isNew=true for all 3 new edge objects we created, but instead we needed to leave isNew=false for the one new edge that is collinear with the old edge, since that edge doesn’t cut across any pre-existing triangle. After fixing this third bug, we finally got nice smooth results.
  </p>
  <br>

  <p>
    Observing the effects of loop subdivision, we see that it successfully alleviates chunky, rough silhouettes and improves image resolution. In regards to corners and edges, we observe that loop subdivision significantly softens sharp corners and edges. This has a stronger effect the sharper the corner/edge, and sometimes leads to dramatic results. Comparing the above images, the base icosahedron is composed of a relatively small number of sharp edges, and becomes quite round as it undergoes repeated subdivision. On the other hand, the teapot was already rather smooth to begin with, and thus better preserves its base shape while smoothening.

    The original teapot mesh still sees significant rounding near the handle region, so we pre-split the edges around the handle. With pre-split edges, notice that the handle better retains its definition following two rounds of upsampling.

    The original cube .dae becomes progressively warped during subdivision. Looking at the base cube shape, we notice its faces are asymmetrically weighted, with some corners having more incident edges than others. This asymmetricality causes the uneven distortion.
  </p>
  <p>
    We pre-process our cube by splitting its faces along certain diagonal edges to produce a symmetrical X pattern on all six faces. This allows the cube to preserve its initial symmetry during upsampling.
