		<h3>
			Point out the new multibounce effects that appear in each image.
		</h3>
		<p>
			0 bounce: Only the light source is visible.
		</p>
		<p>
			1 bounce: The walls are illuminated, but the majority of the spheres are dark. The only illumination on the
			spheres are the parts which directly reflect the area light.
		</p>
		<p>
			2 bounces: Reflections appear on both balls. The ceiling is illuminated.
		</p>
		<p>
			3 bounces: The effect of refraction is evident on the glass sphere. It is thus much brighter. Within the
			mirror sphere, the reflection of the ceiling is lit.
		</p>
		<p>
			4 bounces: There's a new small light on the right wall. The refracting glass sphere appears in the mirror
			sphere.
		</p>
		<p>
			5 bounces: The image is marginally brighter.
		</p>
		<p>
			100 bounces: Essentially no noticible changes.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Explain how these bounce numbers relate to the particular effects that appear. Make sure to include all
			screenshots.
		</h3>
		<p>
			0 bounce: This is the base case. Nothing in the scene can be illuminated (aside from light sources
			themselves) without bounces.
		</p>
		<p>
			1 bounce: We see the effects of direct lighting. The spheres themselves do not emit any color and require
			reflection/refraction. Both of these effects require more than one bounce.
		</p>
		<p>
			2 bounces: The reflection requires two bounces because this allows light to strike the sphere then the box.
			The effects of reflection are much more evident in the mirror ball because in the glass ball, only a portion
			of rays get reflected. The ceiling illumination requires light to bounce off the floor and back to the
			ceiling.
		</p>
		<p>
			3 bounces: The refraction occurs in three bounces because this is enough bounces for light to enter the
			glass sphere, exit the sphere, and hit the surrounding box. Within the mirror ball, the illuminated ceiling
			appears on this bounce because it will always be one bounce behind.
		</p>
		<p>
			4 bounces: Again, the mirror sphere will always be one bounce behind when showing the effect of refraction
			on the glass ball. The light on the right wall took a four bounce path to appear because it needed to bounce
			off the mirror ball, into the glass ball, out of the glass ball, and onto the wall.
		</p>
		<p>
			5 bounces: As was the case with all previous bounces, light has been continuously bouncing off surfaces and
			accumulating over time. This is the effect of indirect light.
		</p>
		<p>
			100 bounces: The vast majority of reflections and refractions have algorithmically halted already due to
			Russian Roulette. This is called convergence.
		</p>

		<h2>Part 4. Depth of Field</h2>
		<h3>
			In a few sentences, explain the differences between a pinhole camera model and a thin-lens camera model.
		</h3>
		<p>
			Both the pinhole camera model and the thin-lens camera model are mathematical models used to represent the
			way a camera captures images.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the pinhole camera model, light passes through the center of the lens and forms an inverted image on the
			screen directly behind it. It assumes the hole is very small such that all rays from a source will pass
			through a singular point (hence the name pinhole). With this geometric relationship, the depth of focus in a
			pinhole camera is theoretically infinite, so our entire render will be in focus simultaneously no matter the
			distances of the objects from the camera.
		</p>
		<p>
			The thin-lens model, however, takes into account the aperture of the lens. Aperture is the size of the lens
			opening; thus, it determines lens radius. In this model, light can pass through any point along the
			thin-lens and will undergo refraction so all rays converge at the same point. With this geometric
			relationship, objects at different distances from the camera will be in focus at different distances from
			the lens.
		</p>
		<p>
			We implemented the thin-lens camera model to obtain this depth-of-focus effect in our renders.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Show a "focus stack" where you focus at 4 visibly different depths through a scene. Make sure to include all
			screenshots.
		</h3>
		<p>
			pixel sample rate = 512, light sample rate = 4, max ray depth depth = 12, aperture = 0.23

		Smaller apertures give a larger depth of field.
