		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>
			In this project, we implemented a real-time cloth simulation using a mass and spring based system. This
			required us to build data structures, apply real-world physics formulas, and implement shaders. We
			particularly enjoyed the GLSL shader portion. There were also a few errors along the way (indexing errors,
			typos, etc.) which we solved through careful debugging and consulting EDstem. Overall, this was a
			challenging but enjoyable task, and served as a great introduction to computer animation.

		</p>

		<h2>Part 1: Masses and springs</h2>
		<h3>Take some screenshots of scene/pinned2.json from a viewing angle where you can clearly see the cloth
			wireframe to show the structure of your point masses and springs.
		</h3>
		<div>
			<img src="images/task1closeup.png" class="normal-image" />
		</div>
		<h3>Show us what the wireframe looks like (1) without any shearing constraints, (2) with only shearing
			constraints, and (3) with all constraints.

		<h2>Part 2: Simulation via numerical integration</h2>
		<h3>
			For each, observe any noticeable differences in the cloth compared to the default parameters and show us
			some screenshots of those interesting differences and describe when they occur:
			<br>Describe the effects of changing the spring constant ks; how does the cloth behave from start to rest
			with a very low ks? A high ks?
			<br>What about for density?
			<br>What about for damping?

		<p>ks represents spring stiffness. Stiffness affects the behavior of cloth by determining the amount of
			resistance that the cloth experiences when stretched. Notice how while keeping other parameters constant, as
			ks increases, the cloth gets pulled tighter. Conversely, lower ks values lead to stretchier cloth that
			droops more.

		<p>ks=5000, damping=1</p>
		<p>The density of an object refers to its concentration of mass. Higher density objects are heavier, which means
			they will have a stronger gravitational pull. We observe that while keeping other parameters constant, as
			density increases, the cloth sinks more due to its higher density and downwards pull.</p>

			</table>
		</div>
		<p>ks=5000, Density=15</p>
		<p>The damping parameter affects spring oscillation. The difference is obvious when playing through the
			animation of the cloth falling. With low damping, the cloth rapidly oscillates back and forth during
			descent. On the other hand, with high damping, we see the fabric fall smoothly. This is because higher
			damping means a quicker loss of energy before stabilizing into equilibrium.</p>
		<p>The above screenshots were taken in the middle of the cloth's descent. Notice the wildly flailing cloth on
			the right.</p>
		<h3>Show us a screenshot of your shaded cloth from scene/pinned4.json in its final resting state! If you choose

		<h2>Part 3: Handling collisions with other objects</h2>
		<h3>Show us screenshots of your shaded cloth from scene/sphere.json in its final resting state on the sphere
			using the default ks = 5000 as well as with ks = 500 and ks = 50000. Describe the differences in the
			results.

		</div>
		<p>As described above, ks denotes the stiffness coefficient of the spring, determining how much resistance the
			cloth experiences when stretched. By adjusting ks, we can control the appearance of the cloth. Setting ks to
			the low value of k=500 yields a flexible cloth that drapes smoothly around the sphere. Lower ks values allow
			more drooping. Conversely, when ks is set to a high value such as k=50000, the cloth will be stiffer and
			retain more of its original shape. The default value, ks=5000, acts as the middle ground, providing a
			moderate level of droopiness between the extremes of high and low stiffness coefficients.</p>
		<h3>Show us a screenshot of your shaded cloth lying peacefully at rest on the plane. If you haven't by now, feel
			free to express your colorful creativity with the cloth! (You will need to complete the shaders portion
			first to show custom colors.)

		<h2>Part 4: Handling self-collisions</h2>
		<h3>Show us at least 3 screenshots that document how your cloth falls and folds on itself, starting with an
			early, initial self-collision and ending with the cloth at a more restful state (even if it is still
			slightly bouncy on the ground).

			</table>
		</div>
		<p>An object's density, defined as its mass per unit area, influences how the cloth falls on itself. Higher
			density objects are heavier, with a stronger gravitational pull that causes the cloth to compress more
			harshly as it falls on itself. Lower density objects are lighter and more flowy, resulting in gentler folds
			as the cloth falls on itself.</p>

			</table>
		</div>
		<p>As described earlier, ks denotes the stiffness coefficient of the spring. A higher ks results in stiffer
			cloth that resists bending, leading to smoother appearance with fewer folds when the cloth falls on itself.
			On the other hand, a cloth with a lower ks value will lose its shape more easily, resulting in more
			pronounced creases.</p>


		<h2>Part 5: Shaders</h2>
		<h3>Explain in your own words what is a shader program and how vertex and fragment shaders work together to
			create lighting and material effects.
		</h3>
		<p>The Central Processing Unit, or CPU, handles the overall functioning of a computer. It's great at
			single-threaded performance, meaning it can very quickly handle one task at a time. However, computer
			graphics applications often require calculations for every pixel on the screen and every bit of geometry.
			Here, the CPU would struggle, so we use a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) instead. The GPU can handle large
			amounts of complex calculations in parallel, using hundreds or thousands of processing cores, and is
			specialized to do things like graphics rendering or simulations very quickly.
		</p>
		<p>GPU code runs special code that we call shaders. Shaders run on data structures containing information about
			how we want our scene to be viewed (including vertices, screen dimensions, camera, colors, etc.). Shaders
			work in two stages, vertex shaders then fragment shaders:
		</p>
		<p>Vertex shaders: This first stage of the process deals with geometry. The vertex shader takes in vertex
			coordinates and transforms them to screen coordinates. It also applies algorithmic transforms to modify
			vertex position, and can also compute lighting and material effects.
		</p>
		<p>
			Fragment shader: The input to the fragment shader is the output from the vertex shader. Its job is to
			determine what colors to display on-screen. For each fragment, the fragment shader computes the appropriate
			final color. This will depend on attributes of the fragment plus blend settings.
		</p>
		<p>Vertex shaders and fragment shaders work together to turn a piece of geometry data into pixels shown
			on-screen.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Explain the Blinn-Phong shading model in your own words. Show a screenshot of your Blinn-Phong shader
			outputting only the ambient component, a screen shot only outputting the diffuse component, a screen shot
			only outputting the specular component, and one using the entire Blinn-Phong model.
		</h3>
		<p>Realistic lighting effects make scenes look more immersive, which enhances the overall visual experience for
			viewers. We use a technique called the Blinn-Phong shading model to simulate how light interacts with
			surfaces. It can be calculated very quickly, making it popular for real-time graphics applications that
			require fast performance.</p>
		<p>In the Blinn-Phong model, the way a surface reflects light is calculated using a formula that takes into
			account the angle of the light, the angle of the viewer, and the angle of the halfway vector between the
			two. This halfway vector is a vector that points halfway between the light source and the viewer, and it's
			used to calculate the specular reflection term of the surface.

		<p>Bump mapping and displacement mapping are both techniques used to add depth to computer graphics. Bump
			mapping simulates small surface irregularities by altering the direction of the surface normal of an object.
			It gives the illusion of bumps, but the object's surface actually remains smooth. In contrast, displacement
			mapping actually modifies object geometry by displacing vertices according to texture grooves. It does so in
			addition to modifying the normals.</p>

		<h3>
			Compare how your the two shaders react to the sphere by changing the sphere mesh's coarseness by using -o 16
			-a 16 and then -o 128 -a 128.

					<td>
						<img src="images/task5displacement16sphere.png" />
						<figcaption><i>Displacement; 128</i></figcaption>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</div>

		<p>We observe that changing coarseness between 16 and 128 doesn't seem to have a very noticeable effect on bump
			mapping but has a large effect on displacement mapping. This is because displacement mapping actually
			modifies object geometry while bump mapping does not. Thus, running displacement mapping at the low
			coarseness level creates sharp, blocky edges that we see here. I would conclude that it is better to run
			bump mapping when restricted to low coarseness levels, or when a simple, quick technique is needed. But
			displacement mapping is preferred at high coarseness or when more accurate, realistic results are needed.
